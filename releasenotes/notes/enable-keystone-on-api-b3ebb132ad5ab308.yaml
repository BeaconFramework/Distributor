prelude: >
    Support for Keystone token authentication on frontend Octavia API.
features:
  - After setting "auth_strategy = keystone" all incoming requests to Octavia
    API will be verified using Keystone are they send by authenticated person.
    By default that option is disabled because Neutron LBaaS v2 is not
    supporting that functionality properly.
upgrade:
  - This feature add new configuration value "auth_strategy" which by default
    is set for "noauth".
