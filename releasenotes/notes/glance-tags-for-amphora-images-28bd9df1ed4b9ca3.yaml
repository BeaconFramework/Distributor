features:
  - Glance image containing the latest Amphora image can now be referenced
    using a Glance tag. To use the feature, set amp_image_tag in
    [controller_worker]. Note that amp_image_id should be unset for the new
    feature to take into effect.
upgrade:
  - amp_image_id option is deprecated and will be removed in one of the next
    releases. Operators are adviced to migrate to the new amp_image_tag option.
