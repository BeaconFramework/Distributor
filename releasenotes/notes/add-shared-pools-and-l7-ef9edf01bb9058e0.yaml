    Adds support for Layer 7 switching and shared pools
    features to Octavia. This supports the equivalent
    feature added to Neutron LBaaS v2.

    * Layer 7 policies allow a tenant / user to define
      actions the load balancer may take other than
      routing requests to the default pool.
    * Layer 7 rules control the logic behind whether a
      given Layer 7 policy is followed.
    * Works for HTTP and TERMINATED_HTTPS listeners.
    * Shared pools allow listeners or Layer 7
      REDIRECT_TO_POOL policies to share back-end
      pools.
upgrade:
  - |
    Upgrade requires a database migration.

    * Shared-pools introduces a new ``load_balancer_id``
      column into the ``pools`` table.
    * ``pools.load_balancer_id`` column is populated
      from ``listeners`` data using ETL in the migration.
    * Two new tables are created to handle Layer 7
      switching. These are ``l7policy`` and ``l7rule``.
