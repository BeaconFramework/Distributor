deprecations:
  - |
    The project_id attribute of the POST method on the following objects
    is now deprecated\: listener, pool, health monitor, and member.
    These objects will use the parent load balancer's project_id.
    Values passed into the project_id on those objects will be ignored
    until the deprecation cycle has expired, at which point they will
    cause an error.
