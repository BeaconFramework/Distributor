    Amphora image support for RH Linux flavors.
features:
  - The diskimage-create script supports different operating system flavors
    such as Ubuntu (the default option), CentOS, Fedora and RHEL. Adaptations
    were made to several elements to ensure all images are operational.
  - The amphora-agent is now able to distinguish between operating systems and
    choose the right course of action to manage files and networking on each
    Linux flavor.
issues:
  - To use CentOS, Fedora, or RHEL in your amphora image you must set
    the user_group option, located in the [haproxy_amphora] section of the
    octavia.conf file to "haproxy".  This will be made automatic in a
    future version.
upgrade:
  - agent_server_network_dir is now auto-detected for Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora
    and RHEL if one is not specified in the configuration file.
