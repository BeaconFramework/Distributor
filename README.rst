Octavia is an operator-grade open source scalable load balancer for use in
large OpenStack deployments. It delivers load balancing services on `amphorae
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/octavia/main/glossary.html>`_ and
provides centralized command and control. Octavia is currently the reference
backend for Neutron LBaaS. In the near future, Octavia is likely to become the
standard OpenStack LBaaS API endpoint.
