Basic Load Balancing Cookbook
=============================

Introduction
============
This document contains several examples of using basic load balancing services
as a tenant or "regular" cloud user.

For the purposes of this guide we assume that the neutron and barbican
command-line interfaces are going to be used to configure all features of
Neutron LBaaS with an Octavia back-end. In order to keep these examples short,
we also assume that tasks not directly associated with deploying load balancing
services have already been accomplished. This might include such things as
deploying and configuring web servers, setting up Neutron networks, obtaining
TLS certificates from a trusted provider, and so on. A description of the
starting conditions is given in each example below.

Please also note that this guide assumes you are familiar with the specific
load balancer terminology defined in the :doc:`../main/glossary`. For a
description of load balancing itself and the Octavia project, please see:
:doc:`../main/introduction`.


Examples
========

Deploy a basic HTTP load balancer
---------------------------------
While this is technically the simplest complete load balancing solution that
can be deployed, we recommend deploying HTTP load balancers with a health
monitor to ensure back-end member availability. See :ref:`basic-lb-with-hm`
below.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with an HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* We want to configure a basic load balancer that is accessible from the
  internet, which distributes web requests to the back-end servers.

**Solution**:

1. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
2. Create listener *listener1*.
3. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
4. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

**CLI commands**:

::

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 public-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --name listener1 --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol HTTP --protocol-port 80
    neutron lbaas-pool-create --name pool1 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener listener1 --protocol HTTP
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.10 --protocol-port 80 pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 80 pool1


.. _basic-lb-with-hm:

Deploy a basic HTTP load balancer with a health monitor
-------------------------------------------------------
This is the simplest recommended load balancing solution for HTTP applications.
This solution is appropriate for operators with provider networks that are not
compatible with Neutron floating-ip functionality (such as IPv6 networks).
However, if you need to retain control of the external IP through which a load
balancer is accessible, even if the load balancer needs to be destroyed or
recreated, it may be more appropriate to deploy your basic load balancer using
a floating IP. See :ref:`basic-lb-with-hm-and-fip` below.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with an HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* These back-end servers have been configured with a health check at the URL
  path "/healthcheck". See :ref:`http-heath-monitors` below.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* We want to configure a basic load balancer that is accessible from the
  internet, which distributes web requests to the back-end servers, and which
  checks the "/healthcheck" path to ensure back-end member health.

**Solution**:

1. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
2. Create listener *listener1*.
3. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
4. Create a health monitor on *pool1* which tests the "/healthcheck" path.
5. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

**CLI commands**:

::

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 public-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --name listener1 --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol HTTP --protocol-port 80
    neutron lbaas-pool-create --name pool1 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener listener1 --protocol HTTP
    neutron lbaas-healthmonitor-create --delay 5 --max-retries 4 --timeout 10 --type HTTP --url_path /healthcheck --pool pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.10 --protocol-port 80 pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 80 pool1


.. _basic-lb-with-hm-and-fip:

Deploy a basic HTTP load balancer using a floating IP
-----------------------------------------------------
It can be beneficial to use a floating IP when setting up a load balancer's VIP
in order to ensure you retain control of the IP that gets assigned as the
floating IP in case the load balancer needs to be destroyed, moved, or
recreated.

Note that this is not possible to do with IPv6 load balancers as floating IPs
do not work with IPv6. Further, there is currently a bug in Neutron Distributed
Virtual Routing (DVR) which prevents floating IPs from working correctly when
DVR is in use. See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1583694

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with an HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* These back-end servers have been configured with a health check at the URL
  path "/healthcheck". See :ref:`http-heath-monitors` below.
* Neutron network *public* is a shared external network created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* We want to configure a basic load balancer that is accessible from the
  internet, which distributes web requests to the back-end servers, and which
  checks the "/healthcheck" path to ensure back-end member health. Further, we
  want to do this using a floating IP.

**Solution**:

1. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *private-subnet*.
2. Create listener *listener1*.
3. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
4. Create a health monitor on *pool1* which tests the "/healthcheck" path.
5. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.
6. Create a floating IP address on *public-subnet*.
7. Associate this floating IP with the *lb1*'s VIP port.

**CLI commands**:

::

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 private-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --name listener1 --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol HTTP --protocol-port 80
    neutron lbaas-pool-create --name pool1 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener listener1 --protocol HTTP
    neutron lbaas-healthmonitor-create --delay 5 --max-retries 4 --timeout 10 --type HTTP --url_path /healthcheck --pool pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.10 --protocol-port 80 pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 80 pool1
    neutron floatingip-create public
    # The following IDs should be visible in the output of previous commands
    neutron floatingip-associate <floating_ip_id> <load_balancer_vip_port_id>


Deploy a basic HTTP load balancer with session persistence
----------------------------------------------------------
**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with an HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* The application is written such that web clients should always be directed to
  the same back-end server throughout their web session, based on an
  application cookie inserted by the web application named 'PHPSESSIONID'.
* These back-end servers have been configured with a health check at the URL
  path "/healthcheck". See :ref:`http-heath-monitors` below.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* We want to configure a basic load balancer that is accessible from the
  internet, which distributes web requests to the back-end servers, persists
  sessions using the PHPSESSIONID as a key, and which checks the "/healthcheck"
  path to ensure back-end member health.

**Solution**:

1. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
2. Create listener *listener1*.
3. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool which defines session
   persistence on the 'PHPSESSIONID' cookie.
4. Create a health monitor on *pool1* which tests the "/healthcheck" path.
5. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

**CLI commands**:

::

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 public-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --name listener1 --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol HTTP --protocol-port 80
    neutron lbaas-pool-create --name pool1 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener listener1 --protocol HTTP --session-persistence type=APP_COOKIE,cookie_name=PHPSESSIONID
    neutron lbaas-healthmonitor-create --delay 5 --max-retries 4 --timeout 10 --type HTTP --url_path /healthcheck --pool pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.10 --protocol-port 80 pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 80 pool1


Deploy a TCP load balancer
--------------------------
This is generally suitable when load balancing a non-HTTP TCP-based service.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with an custom application on TCP port 23456
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* We want to configure a basic load balancer that is accessible from the
  internet, which distributes requests to the back-end servers.
* We want to employ a TCP health check to ensure that the back-end servers are
  available.

**Solution**:

1. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
2. Create listener *listener1*.
3. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
4. Create a health monitor on *pool1* which probes *pool1*'s members' TCP
   service port.
5. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

**CLI commands**:

::

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 public-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --name listener1 --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol TCP --protocol-port 23456
    neutron lbaas-pool-create --name pool1 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener listener1 --protocol TCP
    neutron lbaas-healthmonitor-create --delay 5 --max-retries 4 --timeout 10 --type TCP --pool pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.10 --protocol-port 80 pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 80 pool1


Deploy a non-terminated HTTPS load balancer
-------------------------------------------
A non-terminated HTTPS load balancer acts effectively like a generic TCP load
balancer: The load balancer will forward the raw TCP traffic from the web
client to the back-end servers without decrypting it. This means that the
back-end servers themselves must be configured to terminate the HTTPS
connection with the web clients, and in turn, the load balancer cannot insert
headers into the HTTP session indicating the client IP address. (That is, to
the back-end server, all web requests will appear to originate from the load
balancer.) Also, advanced load balancer features (like Layer 7 functionality)
cannot be used with non-terminated HTTPS.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with a TLS-encrypted web application on TCP port 443.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* We want to configure a basic load balancer that is accessible from the
  internet, which distributes requests to the back-end servers.
* We want to employ a TCP health check to ensure that the back-end servers are
  available.

**Solution**:

1. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
2. Create listener *listener1*.
3. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
4. Create a health monitor on *pool1* which probes *pool1*'s members' TCP
   service port.
5. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

**CLI commands**:

::

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 public-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --name listener1 --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol HTTPS --protocol-port 443
    neutron lbaas-pool-create --name pool1 --lb-algorithm ROUND_ROBIN --listener listener1 --protocol HTTPS
    neutron lbaas-healthmonitor-create --delay 5 --max-retries 4 --timeout 10 --type TCP --pool pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.10 --protocol-port 443 pool1
    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 443 pool1


.. _basic-tls-terminated-listener:

Deploy a TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancer
-------------------------------------------
With a TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancer, web clients communicate with the
load balancer over TLS protocols. The load balancer terminates the TLS session
and forwards the decrypted requests to the back-end servers. By terminating the
TLS session on the load balancer, we offload the CPU-intensive encryption work
to the load balancer, and enable the possibility of using advanced load
balancer features, like Layer 7 features and header manipulation.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with regular HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* These back-end servers have been configured with a health check at the URL
  path "/healthcheck". See :ref:`http-heath-monitors` below.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* A TLS certificate, key, and intermediate certificate chain for
  www.example.com have been obtained from an external certificate authority.
  These now exist in the files server.crt, server.key, and ca-chain.p7b in the
  current directory. The key and certificate are PEM-encoded, and the
  intermediate certificate chain is PKCS7 PEM encoded. The key is not encrypted
  with a passphrase.
* The *admin* user on this cloud installation has keystone ID *admin_id*
* We want to configure a TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancer that is accessible
  from the internet using the key and certificate mentioned above, which
  distributes requests to the back-end servers over the non-encrypted HTTP
  protocol.

**Solution**:

1. Create barbican *secret* resources for the certificate, key, and
   intermediate certificate chain. We will call these *cert1*, *key1*, and
   *intermediates1* respectively.
2. Create a *secret container* resource combining all of the above. We will
   call this *tls_container1*.
3. Grant the *admin* user access to all the *secret* and *secret container*
   barbican resources above.
4. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
5. Create listener *listener1* as a TERMINATED_HTTPS listener referencing
   *tls_container1* as its default TLS container.
6. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
7. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

**CLI commands**:

::

    openstack secret store --name='cert1' --payload-content-type='text/plain' --payload="$(cat server.crt)"
    openstack secret store --name='key1' --payload-content-type='text/plain' --payload="$(cat server.key)"
    openstack secret store --name='intermediates1' --payload-content-type='text/plain' --payload="$(cat ca-chain.p7b)"

    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-create --name lb1 public-subnet
    # Re-run the following until lb1 shows ACTIVE and ONLINE statuses:
    neutron lbaas-loadbalancer-show lb1
    neutron lbaas-listener-create --loadbalancer lb1 --protocol-port 443 --protocol TERMINATED_HTTPS --name listener1 --default-tls-container=$(openstack secret container list | awk '/ tls_container1 / {print $2}')

    neutron lbaas-member-create --subnet private-subnet --address 192.0.2.11 --protocol-port 80 pool1


Deploy a TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancer with SNI
----------------------------------------------------
This example is exactly like :ref:`basic-tls-terminated-listener`, except that
we have multiple TLS certificates that we would like to use on the same
listener using Server Name Indication (SNI) technology.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with regular HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* These back-end servers have been configured with a health check at the URL
  path "/healthcheck". See :ref:`http-heath-monitors` below.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* TLS certificates, keys, and intermediate certificate chains for
  www.example.com and www2.example.com have been obtained from an external
  certificate authority. These now exist in the files server.crt, server.key,
  ca-chain.p7b, server2.crt, server2-encrypted.key, and ca-chain2.p7b in the
  current directory. The keys and certificates are PEM-encoded, and the
  intermediate certificate chains are PKCS7 PEM encoded.
* The key for www.example.com is not encrypted with a passphrase.
* The key for www2.example.com is encrypted with the passphrase "abc123".
* The *admin* user on this cloud installation has keystone ID *admin_id*
* We want to configure a TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancer that is accessible
  from the internet using the keys and certificates mentioned above, which
  distributes requests to the back-end servers over the non-encrypted HTTP
  protocol.
* If a web client connects that is not SNI capable, we want the load balancer
  to respond with the certificate for www.example.com.

**Solution**:

1. Create barbican *secret* resources for the certificates, keys, and
   intermediate certificate chains. We will call these *cert1*, *key1*,
   *intermediates1*, *cert2*, *key2* and *intermediates2* respectively.
2. Create a barbican *secret* resource *passphrase2* for the passphrase for
   *key2*
3. Create *secret container* resources combining the above appropriately. We
   will call these *tls_container1* and *tls_container2*.
4. Grant the *admin* user access to all the *secret* and *secret container*
   barbican resources above.
5. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
6. Create listener *listener1* as a TERMINATED_HTTPS listener referencing
   *tls_container1* as its default TLS container, and referencing both
   *tls_container1* and *tls_container2* using SNI.
7. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
8. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.

Deploy HTTP and TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancing on the same IP and backend
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example is exactly like :ref:`basic-tls-terminated-listener`, except that
we would like to have both an HTTP and TERMINATED_HTTPS listener that use the
same back-end pool (and therefore, probably respond with the exact same
content regardless of whether the web client uses the HTTP or HTTPS protocol
to connect).

Please note that if you wish all HTTP requests to be redirected to HTTPS (so
that requests are only served via HTTPS, and attempts to access content over
HTTP just get redirected to the HTTPS listener), then please see `the example
<l7-cookbook.html#redirect-http-to-https>`__ in the :doc:`l7-cookbook`.

**Scenario description**:

* Back-end servers 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on subnet *private-subnet* have
  been configured with regular HTTP application on TCP port 80.
* These back-end servers have been configured with a health check at the URL
  path "/healthcheck". See :ref:`http-heath-monitors` below.
* Subnet *public-subnet* is a shared external subnet created by the cloud
  operator which is reachable from the internet.
* A TLS certificate, key, and intermediate certificate chain for
  www.example.com have been obtained from an external certificate authority.
  These now exist in the files server.crt, server.key, and ca-chain.p7b in the
  current directory. The key and certificate are PEM-encoded, and the
  intermediate certificate chain is PKCS7 PEM encoded. The key is not encrypted
  with a passphrase.
* The *admin* user on this cloud installation has keystone ID *admin_id*
* We want to configure a TLS-terminated HTTPS load balancer that is accessible
  from the internet using the key and certificate mentioned above, which
  distributes requests to the back-end servers over the non-encrypted HTTP
  protocol.
* We also want to configure a HTTP load balancer on the same IP address as
  the above which serves the exact same content (ie. forwards to the same
  back-end pool) as the TERMINATED_HTTPS listener.

**Solution**:

1. Create barbican *secret* resources for the certificate, key, and
   intermediate certificate chain. We will call these *cert1*, *key1*, and
   *intermediates1* respectively.
2. Create a *secret container* resource combining all of the above. We will
   call this *tls_container1*.
3. Grant the *admin* user access to all the *secret* and *secret container*
   barbican resources above.
4. Create load balancer *lb1* on subnet *public-subnet*.
5. Create listener *listener1* as a TERMINATED_HTTPS listener referencing
   *tls_container1* as its default TLS container.
6. Create pool *pool1* as *listener1*'s default pool.
7. Add members 192.0.2.10 and 192.0.2.11 on *private-subnet* to *pool1*.
8. Create listener *listener2* as an HTTP listener with *pool1* as its
   default pool.

Heath Monitor Best Practices
============================
While it is possible to set up a listener without a health monitor, if a
back-end pool member goes down, Octavia will not remove the failed server from
the pool until a considerable time has passed. This can lead to service
disruption for web clients. Because of this, we recommend always configuring
production load balancers to use a health monitor.

The health monitor itself is a process that does periodic health checks on each
back-end server to pre-emptively detect failed servers and temporarily pull
them out of the pool. Since effective health monitors depend as much on
back-end application server configuration as proper load balancer
configuration, some additional discussion of best practices is warranted here.

See also: :doc:`../api/octaviaapi`


Heath monitor options
---------------------
All of the health monitors Octavia supports have the following configurable
options:

* ``delay``: Number of seconds to wait between health checks.
* ``timeout``: Number of seconds to wait for any given health check to
  complete. ``timeout`` should always be smaller than ``delay``.
* ``max-retries``: Number of subsequent health checks a given back-end
  server must fail before it is considered *down*, or that a failed back-end
  server must pass to be considered *up* again.


.. _http-heath-monitors:

HTTP health monitors
--------------------
In general, the application-side component of HTTP health checks are a part of
the web application being load balanced. By default, Octavia will probe the "/"
path on the application server. However, in many applications this is not
appropriate because the "/" path ends up being a cached page, or causes the
application server to do more work than is necessary for a basic health check.

In addition to the above options, HTTP health monitors also have the following
options:

* ``url_path``: Path part of the URL that should be retrieved from the back-end
  server. By default this is "/".
* ``http_method``: HTTP method that should be used to retrieve the
  ``url_path``. By default this is "GET".
* ``expected_codes``: List of HTTP status codes that indicate an OK health
  check. By default this is just "200".

Please keep the following best practices in mind when writing the code that
generates the health check in your web application:

* The health monitor ``url_path`` should not require authentication to load.
* By default the health monitor ``url_path`` should return a HTTP 200 OK status
  code to indicate a healthy server unless you specify alternate
  ``expected_codes``.
* The health check should do enough internal checks to ensure the application
  is healthy and no more. This may mean ensuring database or other external
  storage connections are up and running, server load is acceptable, the site
  is not in maintenance mode, and other tests specific to your application.
* The page generated by the health check should be very light weight:

  * It should return in a sub-second interval.
  * It should not induce significant load on the application server.

* The page generated by the health check should never be cached, though the
  code running the health check may reference cached data. For example, you may
  find it useful to run a more extensive health check via cron and store the
  results of this to disk. The code generating the page at the health monitor
  ``url_path`` would incorporate the results of this cron job in the tests it
  performs.
* Since Octavia only cares about the HTTP status code returned, and since
  health checks are run so frequently, it may make sense to use the "HEAD" or
  "OPTIONS" HTTP methods to cut down on unnecessary processing of a whole page.


Other heath monitors
--------------------
Other health monitor types include ``PING``, ``TCP`` and ``HTTPS``.

``PING`` health monitors send periodic ICMP PING requests to the back-end
servers. Obviously, your back-end servers must be configured to allow PINGs in
order for these health checks to pass.

``TCP`` health monitors open a TCP connection to the back-end server's protocol
port. Your custom TCP application should be written to respond OK to the load
balancer connecting, opening a TCP connection, and closing it again after the
TCP handshake without sending any data.

``HTTPS`` health monitors operate exactly like HTTP health monitors, except
that they also ensure the back-end server responds to SSLv3 client hello
messages.


Intermediate certificate chains
===============================
Some TLS certificates require you to install an intermediate certificate chain
in order for web client browsers to trust the certificate. This chain can take
several forms, and is a file provided by the organization from whom you
obtained your TLS certificate.

PEM-encoded chains
------------------
The simplest form of the intermediate chain is a PEM-encoded text file that
either contains a sequence of individually-encoded PEM certificates, or a PEM
encoded PKCS7 block(s). If this is the type of intermediate chain you have been
provided, the file will contain either ``-----BEGIN PKCS7-----`` or
``-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`` near the top of the file, and one or more
blocks of 64-character lines of ASCII text (that will look like gobbedlygook to
a human). These files are also typically named with a ``.crt`` or ``.pem``
extension.

To upload this type of intermediates chain to barbican, run a command similar
to the following (assuming "intermediates-chain.pem" is the name of the file):

::

    openstack secret store --name='intermediates1' --payload-content-type='text/plain' --payload="$(cat intermediates-chain.pem)"

DER-encoded chains
------------------
If the intermediates chain provided to you is a file that contains what appears
to be random binary data, it is likely that it is a PKCS7 chain in DER format.
These files also may be named with a ``.p7b`` extension. In order to use this
intermediates chain, you can either convert it to a series of PEM-encoded
certificates with the following command:

::

    openssl pkcs7 -in intermediates-chain.p7b -inform DER -print_certs -out intermediates-chain.pem

...or convert it into a PEM-encoded PKCS7 bundle with the following command:

::

    openssl pkcs7 -in intermediates-chain.p7b -inform DER -outform PEM -out intermediates-chain.pem

...or simply upload the binary DER file to barbican without conversion:

::

    openstack secret store --name='intermediates1' --payload-content-type='application/octet-stream' --payload-content-encoding='base64' --payload="$(cat intermediates-chain.p7b | base64)"

In any case, if the file is not a PKCS7 DER bundle, then either of the above
two openssl commands will fail.
